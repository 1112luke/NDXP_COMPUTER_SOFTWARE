## Introduction

While initially designed and developed for NDXP, all vehicle applications were heavily considered during the process. The result is a computer that is <i>intended</i> to be used for any and all rocketry vehicles!

## Contributing
This repository is open at all times to any member submitting a Pull Request and merging their code directly into the main branch after approval! If you don't know what a Pull Request is, or if this is your first time using github, it is recommended that you watch [this](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world) guide before you begin.

 - Have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your computer (macos should by default).
 - Have [kicad](https://www.kicad.org/) installed on your computer
 - Are added as a repository contributor (ask a team lead)

To make a contribution, the generall process is:

<b><i>clone/pull ‚Üí branch ‚Üí make your changes ‚Üí add;commit;push ‚Üí request approval for merge</i></b>

Each step is broken down as follows:

### Clone/Pull ü§ñ
If this is your first time interacting with this repository on your local machine, execute the following command in the location on your computer you wish to clone the repository to:

```
git clone https://github.com/1112luke/CubeFlightComputer
```

If you have the repository already and wish to begin a new contribution <b><u>it is important that you get the most recent version of the repository: </u></b>

```
git switch main
git pull origin main --rebase
```

### Branch ü™æ
Once you have an up to date copy of the repository on your local machine, you will need to create a new branch for your contribution:

```
git branch -c branch-name
```

```
git switch branch-name
```

Feel free to name it whatever you want. Be descriptive!

### Make Your Changes üë®‚Äçüíª

When you are satisfied with your contribution, execute the following steps to push your changes to github for review:

```
git add .
```

```
git commit -m "your-descriptive-message"
```

```
git push origin branch-name
```

Once that is done, your code should be pushed to this repository! The final step is to submit a pull request for your code to the main branch using this website, and it will be reviewed for merge shortly!


### RULE OF THUMB!!
In general, commits to github should be <b>small</b> and <b>frequent</b>! This ensures that everybody is working with the most up to date version of the code!
